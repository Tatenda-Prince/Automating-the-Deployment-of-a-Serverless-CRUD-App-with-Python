# Slim the Developer

Introducing Slim, the developer who has now mastered the basics of AWS Lambda! But his interest has been sparked much more. He considers a personal project that would challenge his abilities and appeal to his experience in software development, using his newly acquired understanding of serverless architectures on AWS. He also longs to learn more about Amazon API Gateway and Amazon DynamoDB, two more potent serverless services. The scene in now set for “Slim the Developer” to take center stage once again.


## What is the Backend

 When it comes to web application development, the backend is the engine behind the scenes that makes the web application function. It is responsible for data storage, business logic and handling user requests.

It differs from the frontend, which is the user-facing part that allows users to interact with and use the application directly in their web browsers, as the backend is responsible for managing and serving the relevant data to the frontend.

Both frontend and backend work together to create a web application.
